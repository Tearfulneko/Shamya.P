<p> I am a born and raised Chicagoen borned on July 10<sup>th</sup>, 1999 around 11:00 p.m.(I find this ironic since I more of a morning person than a night owl). My twin brother Shamar was born two minutes later. My ethnicity is America  and race is African-American.

<p>I live in a six-person household with my mom, dad, older sister Shamara (by five year), grandmother (dad's side), and my twin brother Shamar. Interesting fact about my siblings and I: Our names are based of my dad's name Shawndale. My grandmother mix up the names sometimes. Very understandable.</h3>

<p>I grew up in a small African-American neighborhood on the west side of Chicago near Cicero & Augusta. The name Augusta was so weird to me when I was little; it was so distinct. I also visited this park called Augusta Park which  I still remember playing on the swings, and playing Super Mario 2 in the community  center(In the building on the right).</p>

<p>The earliest memories I can recall from pre-school/kindergarden years includeshaving a small purple polyester blanket that I used to make hammocks on bunk beds, choosing a tiger stuff animal that would be call brillantly "Tiger" from a Walmart (I still have that same stuff animals it been twelve years since), being overprotective over my brother, being mischevious in class, seeing my former cat Stripes running from thrown snowballs, and drawing animals on the wall of my bedroom. 
<p>My first elementary school was Piccolo Academy which was just a three-minute walk away. My brother and I transferred out in the middle of fourth grade because my family had to move(Will explain more later). My first friends I can remember were Jasmine and Romeo; they were the few people who didn't take advantage of my very naive mind back then. My only interests during my time at Piccolo was playing outside the nearby neighborhood kids, nature (especially big cats), and drawing animals.I was not a sporty person at Piccolo and the only sport I was good at was Dodgeball.</p>

<p> Biking, however, was a big point of my active life before the move. My grandfather did errands for people in the neighborhood collected cans for money so he traveled by bike. My brother and I were more escatic about bike-riding with granddad than my sister as she was hanging out with friends more. When me and my brothers received bikes as birthday presents we were on the rode our grandad. Our common destination to bike was Garfield Park-which was a bit far from our house. One summer day we biked from noon to five o'clock at night to my uncle's house.  </p>
